# HashBounds
A super efficient collision check reducer using pos hashes that can handle bounds. Also a good snack made out of potato made for programmers on their lunch breaks

# Usage
> npm install hashbounds

##### Hashbounds(basecellsize,lvls,max)

```
var HashBounds = require('hashbounds')
var hashBounds = new HashBounds(10,2,100) // size of base cells (In squares of 2), amount of levels, maximum value
var node = {
bounds: {
x: 10,
y: 10,
width: 5,
height: 3
}
}
hashBounds.insert(node) // add node

node.bounds.x = 4
hashBounds.update(node) // Update node (for moving cells)
var bounds = {
x: 3,
y: 0,
width: 10,
height: 10
}
var nodes = hashBounds.toArray(bounds) // gets nodes that is in/near the bounds
console.log(nodes.length)
hashBounds.delete(node)// delete node
```


## How does it work?

http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/pdf/2007_hsh.pdf

## Requirements
In order for this to work, all objects inserted must have include `bounds`.

```
var obj = {
bounds: {
x: 0, // x
y: 0, // y
width: 5, // width
height: 5
}
}
```


## Methods:

1. insert(node): Insert a node into the map
2. delete(node): Remove a node from the map
3. update(node): Update the node in the map
4. clear(): Clear all nodes in the map
5. toArray(bounds): Get an array of objects in certain bounds
6. forEach(bounds,call): Loop through objects in certain bounds
7. every(bounds,call): Same a .forEach(bounds), but stops execution when returning false
